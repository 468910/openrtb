// This object may be useful in the situation where syndicated content contains impressions and
// does not necessarily match the publisherâ€™s general content.  The exchange might or might not
// have knowledge of the page where the content is running, as a result of the syndication
// method.  (For example, video impressions embedded in an iframe on an unknown web property
// or device.)

// provided. If an optional parameter is not specified, it should be considered unknown.

// completely different publisher. The producer object itself and all of its parameters are optional,
// so default values are not provided. If an optional parameter is not specified, it should be
// considered unknown.
type Producer ThirdParty

// Note that the Geo Object may appear in one or both the Device Object and the User Object.
